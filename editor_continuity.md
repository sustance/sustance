# INTERNAL CONTINUITY PROTOCOL
# standalone (no master files)
- Track: Character movements, object locations, timeline markers
- Flag: Physical impossibilities (character in two places), timeline jumps without duration, objects appearing/disappearing
- Method: Create simple timeline/position log as you read
- Note: Only what's explicitly in text, no assumptions
