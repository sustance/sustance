# Marcus Weber & Orbital Heavy Industries (OHI)

## Company Overview: Orbital Heavy Industries

**Founded:** 2018 (publicly announced 2020)
**Headquarters:** Administered through Liechtenstein, launch facilities on Kiritimati (Christmas Island, Kiribati)
**CEO/Founder:** Marcus Weber (German, age 52)
**Breakthrough:** December 2025 orbital launch shocked industry
**Current Status:** 6 successful orbital launches, 2 orbital refueling demonstrations

### The OHI Story

Orbital Heavy Industries emerged from the intersection of European frustration with US launch dominance, 
aggressive entrepreneurship, and fortunate timing. 
Marcus Weber, a former Airbus executive and aerospace engineer, left in 2017 to pursue what many 
considered an impossible dream: building Europe's answer to SpaceX from scratch.

### The "Secret" Development (2018-2025)

Weber spent seven years developing heavy-lift capability with remarkably little public visibility. 
The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023) provided unexpected cover—remote work, travel restrictions, 
and global distraction meant his Pacific island operations drew minimal attention.

**Funding Sources:**
- German government technology development grants through KfW Development Bank (€400M over 5 years)
- European Investment Bank loans for "advanced manufacturing research" (€300M)
- Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund investment (UAE, Qatar—undisclosed amounts, estimated €500M-800M)
- Private European investors (primarily German industrial families seeking strategic tech exposure)
- Pre-sold launch contracts to European satellite operators (€200M advance payments)

**Total estimated investment: €1.5-2B** (vs SpaceX's ~$10B to comparable capability)

**Technology Acquisition (All Legal):**
- Purchased expired and near-expired patents aggressively from US, Russian, and European sources
- Hired engineers during SpaceX 2022 layoffs, Blue Origin restructuring, and Arianespace downsizing
- Leveraged publicly available research from NASA technical papers, academic publications, and patent filings
- Extensive analysis of publicly broadcast launches (telemetry, performance data)
- European Space Agency collaborative research agreements (legal tech transfer)
- Benefited from Ariane program's decades of European propulsion research

**Nothing was stolen—everything exploited legal gaps and publicly available information**

### The Kiritimati Advantage

Christmas Island (Kiribati) provided unique advantages:
- **Location:** Near-equatorial (2°N) launch advantage—reduces fuel requirements by ~15%
- **Jurisdiction:** Maritime launch operations, minimal regulatory oversight
- **Economics:** Kiribati government needed revenue; 99-year lease provided infrastructure investment
- **Geography:** Pacific Ocean splash zones for testing, minimal population for safety concerns
- **Isolation:** Perfect for secret development; nearest major population 3,000km away

Weber leased 40 square kilometers for 99 years. Local government receives:
- $50M annual lease payments
- Infrastructure development (port, power, communications)
- Employment for 200+ local workers
- Educational scholarships for Kiribati students

Environmental groups criticized the ecological impact, but Weber maintains strict environmental 
protocols and publishes annual sustainability reports.

### The COVID-19 Cover (2020-2023)

The pandemic years were crucial for OHI:
- **Travel restrictions** meant fewer observers, less media attention
- **Remote work normalization** allowed distributed engineering teams to operate seamlessly
- **Supply chain disruptions** affected competitors more than OHI (smaller, more agile)
- **Global distraction** meant aerospace news received minimal coverage
- **Economic uncertainty** made investors more willing to back unconventional ventures

Weber conducted "research hops" and sub-orbital tests publicly, framing them as advanced materials testing. 
What nobody knew: parallel development of orbital capability on the eastern platform, hidden 
from commercial satellite observation by timing and positioning.

### The December 2025 Surprise

**December 18, 2025:** OHI launched "Prometheus-1" to orbit carrying an 80-ton test payload—comparable to 
SpaceX's Starship capability.

Weber's announcement:
> "We've been conducting sub-orbital tests publicly for five years.
> What we didn't mention: we've been conducting orbital launches from our secondary facility for six months,with four successful missions. Today, we're announcing commercial service. Europe has its heavy-lift champion."

**Global Reaction:**
- **European space industry:** Celebration mixed with shock
- **SpaceX:** Dismissive ("We'll see if they can maintain cadence")
- **Blue Origin:** Cried foul (investigation requests filed, found nothing illegal)
- **NASA:** Cautious interest, began quiet discussions
- **ESA:** Relieved—finally, a European heavy-lift option
- **Industry analysts:** Stunned—how did they develop so fast and quietly?

### Current Capabilities (Early 2026)

**Prometheus Heavy Launcher:**
- **Payload capacity:** 80-100 tons to LEO, 35 tons to Mars transfer orbit
- **Reusability:** Fully reusable first stage, 80% reusable second stage
- **Propellant:** Methane/LOX (simpler than SpaceX's Raptor engines, slightly less efficient but more reliable)
- **Recovery:** Ocean landing platform (first stage returns to ship 200km from launch site)
- **Refueling:** Demonstrated on-orbit cryogenic refueling (critical for deep space missions)
- **Launch cadence:** Currently 1 per month, ramping to 2 per month by mid-2026
- **Cost:** ~30% less than SpaceX equivalent missions

**How they keep costs down:**
- Smaller workforce (350 vs SpaceX's 13,000+)
- Lower regulatory compliance costs (maritime jurisdiction)
- Simpler engine design (fewer parts, easier manufacturing)
- Aggressive use of commercial off-the-shelf components
- Lower labor costs (international workforce, island location)

### The Questions That Won't Go Away

Despite legal operations, OHI faces persistent skepticism:

**"Where did the money really come from?"**
- Answer: Documented sources, but amounts remain partially opaque (private investors, commercial confidentiality)
- Concern: Could there be undisclosed backers with strategic interests?

**"How did they develop so fast?"**
- Answer: Focused team, aggressive use of expired IP, hired experienced engineers, COVID cover
- Concern: Seems almost too efficient—what aren't we seeing?

**"Are there hidden ownership interests?"**
- Answer: Corporate structure through Liechtenstein is legal but deliberately complex
- Concern: Ultimate beneficial ownership unclear beyond Weber's controlling stake

**"What about safety margins?"**
- Answer: Certified by international maritime authorities, meets ISO standards
- Concern: Only 6 launches—small track record, possibly cutting corners vs. NASA's extreme caution

**"Environmental impact?"**
- Answer: Annual sustainability reports, environmental monitoring, strict protocols
- Concern: Pacific island ecosystem fragile; long-term effects unknown

**Labor practices?**
- Answer: Competitive salaries, safety records published
- Concern: Reports of intense work culture, 80-hour weeks common (denied as industry standard)

### Who Uses OHI (Early 2026)

**Current customers:**
- German commercial satellite operators (Bavarian space tech companies)
- ESA scientific missions (cost-sensitive research payloads)
- Middle Eastern communication satellites (UAE, Saudi Arabia)
- Academic institutions across Europe (price matters more than reputation)
- Emerging space nations (Brazil, South Africa, India considering)
- Private space ventures unable to afford SpaceX or lacking US ITAR clearance

**Who avoids OHI:**
- US military and intelligence (ITAR restrictions, security clearance issues)
- Major US commercial satellite operators (SpaceX relationships, insurance complications)
- Some European defense contractors (security clearance complications)
- Companies requiring absolute reliability over cost (reputation risk-averse)

**Why some clients are cautious:**
- Small track record (only 6 successful launches)
- Insurance premiums 15-20% higher than SpaceX
- Reputational concerns (associated with "gray zone" operations)
- Questions about long-term stability and support
- Unknown failure modes (what happens if something goes wrong?)

### Perfect for Your Protagonists' Mission

**Why Chinese billionaire + Risk Manager choose OHI:**

✅ **SpaceX unavailable:** US-China tensions, ITAR restrictions on Chinese nationals in sensitive programs
✅ **Blue Origin insufficient:** Doesn't have heavy-lift capability yet (still developing)
✅ **Ariane/ESA too expensive/slow:** Traditional European space moves at government pace
✅ **OHI has proven capability:** 6 successful orbital launches, 2 refueling demonstrations
✅ **Cost effective:** 30% less than alternatives, important for private mission funding
✅ **Available timeline:** Can launch within mission window (others can't)
✅ **Willing to work with international clients:** No geopolitical restrictions
✅ **Marcus Weber initiates as a parnership:** Webers backers pay launch costs up front. Prove their tech and get future rewards

**The risk calculation:**
- Risk Manager's due diligence finds: Everything legal, but uncomfortable questions
- Billionaire sees: Capable maverick who solved hard problem (recognizes kindred spirit)
- Committee debates: Accept reputational risk vs. mission timeline
- Decision: Proceed, but with extensive oversight and contingency planning
