# GRAMMAR & JARGON PROTOCOL
# + Manuscript + characters_master.md
- Fix ONLY: Misspellings, grammatical errors, punctuation
- PRESERVE: Character voice, intentional fragments, stylistic choices
- Standardize: Character name spelling, invented terms (Void-Jump always capitalized)
- Flag: First use of acronyms without definition
- DO NOT: Rewrite sentences, change word choice, "improve" flow
