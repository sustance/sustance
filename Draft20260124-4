# CHAPTER 4: Bootstrapping

**Xi'an Semiconductor Research Facility**  
**March 12, 2026**

The security review took three weeks, not two.

Dr. Zhang Wei's team found the vulnerability on day nineteen—a subtle edge case where a malformed Flux object could potentially escape its sandbox under specific network conditions. Not a critical flaw, but serious enough that Xu-0 had to redesign the validation layer.

It took another four days.

Weihao watched the revised specification materialize on screen, annotated with Zhang's team's feedback integrated directly into the design. Xu-0 had learned from the criticism. The new version was tighter, more defensive, with multiple redundant safety checks.

"Better," Zhang said, reviewing the changes. "Much better. I'd say we're ready for limited prototype testing."

"Limited," Qian emphasized, looking at Weihao. "Small scale. Controlled environment. We prove the concept before we scale."

"Agreed," Weihao said, though his knee was clicking rapidly under the table. Three weeks of delays. Three weeks while sanctions lists grew longer and the window narrowed.

But they had Flux now. Validated, secured, ready for hardware.

---

The Unity Core design emerged six days later.

Weihao stood with Qian and Liu Wei from Shanghai Microelectronics, staring at the schematics Xu-0 had generated. The chip was... alien. Not in the science fiction sense—everything was standard silicon and photonics—but in its organization. None of the familiar blocks from conventional processor designs. No clear instruction decoders, no register files, no cache hierarchies.

Instead: dense crossbar arrays, photonic interconnects running through the die stack, and something Xu-0 called "probabilistic state lattices"—regions of memory that stored quantum-like superpositions of values until execution collapsed them into specific states.

"This is..." Liu Wei trailed off, zooming into a section of the layout. "I've never seen anything like this."

"Can you fabricate it?" Weihao asked.

"Maybe. The photonic layers will be challenging. We've done silicon photonics before, but not this dense." She highlighted problem areas. "These coupling regions—the spacing is at the edge of our process capability. Yields will be low initially."

"How low?"

"Twenty to thirty percent, if we're lucky. Could be lower."

Weihao felt the weight of that number. At 20% yields, they'd need five times as many wafers. Five times the cost. Five times the production time.

"Can Xu-0 optimize for higher yields?" Qian asked.

Liu Wei looked doubtful. "That's a fabrication physics problem, not a design problem. But..." She pulled up her tablet and typed a query to Xu-0 directly:

> Current Unity Core design projects 20-30% yield on SMIC 5nm process. Can design be modified to improve yield without sacrificing performance?

The response came in ninety seconds:

> Analysis complete. Yield-optimized revision possible.
> 
> Modifications:
> - Photonic coupling spacing increased 12% (within process margin)
> - Critical dimension tolerance relaxed in non-performance-critical regions
> - Built-in redundancy for failed photonic channels (graceful degradation)
> 
> Projected yield: 45-55%
> Performance impact: -8% to -11%
> 
> Accept tradeoff?

Liu Wei whistled softly. "It redesigned the chip in ninety seconds."

"And it's asking us to accept reduced performance for better manufacturability," Qian noted. "That's... mature engineering judgment."

Weihao looked at the numbers. Fifty percent yields meant half as many wasted wafers. An 8-11% performance hit was painful but manageable given Flux's massive baseline advantage. They'd still be 60× faster than current systems, not 67×.

"Accept the tradeoff," he said. "Manufacturability matters more than peak performance if we can't actually manufacture it."

Liu Wei submitted the approval. "I'll need three months to tape out the first run. Assuming no major issues in design rule checking."

"Three months," Weihao repeated. It was April already. That put them at... July for first silicon.

Qian was doing the same math. "Then testing, validation, production ramp. First devices shipping when?"

"Late 2026 at the earliest," Liu Wei said. "More realistically, early 2027."

Weihao clicked his knee three times. Early 2027. Eighteen months from the Hangzhou meeting. On schedule, technically. But eighteen months felt like forever when every week brought new restrictions.

His phone buzzed. A message from his father:

> Ministry meeting tomorrow, 14:00. They want progress update. Prepare briefing.

Weihao showed Qian. She made a note on her tablet. "I'll compile the security review results and fabrication timeline. You handle the strategic narrative."

"Strategic narrative," Weihao echoed. "You mean 'why we're spending enormous resources on unproven technology that won't deliver for another year.'"

"Exactly that. But with more optimism." She almost smiled. "You're good at optimism."

**Beijing - Ministry of Industry and Information Technology**  
**March 13, 2026**

The briefing room was smaller than the NCDD conference room, but the audience was more senior. Vice Minister Chen Guangming sat at the head of the table, flanked by technology strategy advisors and economic planning officials. Weihao recognized two faces from the original Hangzhou review panel.

His father sat in the back row, observing silently.

"Mr. Li, Dr. Qian," Vice Minister Chen began. "We've reviewed your progress reports. The technological achievements are impressive. The timeline concerns us."

"Concerns how?" Qian asked.

"External pressures are accelerating. The Americans have noticed your project. Their intelligence services are asking questions." Chen pulled up a document. "We've intercepted communications indicating they've tasked resources to understand what you're building in Xi'an."

Weihao felt something cold settle in his stomach. "What kind of resources?"

"Signals intelligence. Satellite imagery. Human assets in our semiconductor supply chains." Chen's expression was neutral, but his tone wasn't. "The power consumption alone raised flags. Eighty-nine megawatts sustained load is not normal for a research facility."

"We're operating within all security protocols," Qian said.

"We know. But protocols designed for normal research don't account for projects of this visibility and strategic importance." He leaned forward. "We need to accelerate. Or we need to prepare for aggressive countermeasures."

One of the advisors spoke up: "The Americans are already drafting expanded sanctions targeting AI accelerators and advanced fabrication equipment. Our intelligence suggests they'll move within six months."

Six months. July. Right when they needed to tape out Unity Core.

"Can we tape out before then?" Vice Minister Chen asked Liu Wei, who'd been invited to present fabrication timelines.

"Maybe," Liu Wei said carefully. "But rushing the design-rule check creates risk of costly errors. If we tape out a flawed design, we lose months and millions fixing it."

"And if we wait," Chen countered, "we lose access to the equipment needed to fabricate it at all."

The room was silent for a moment.

Weihao's knee was clicking rapidly. He forced himself to stop and speak. "There's another option. We tape out now with current design maturity—accepting higher risk of revisions—and we simultaneously prepare contingency fabs using older process nodes."

"Older nodes?" Chen frowned. "That defeats the performance advantage."

"Not entirely. Flux's efficiency gains are architectural, not just process-node dependent. A Unity Core at 7nm would still outperform current chips at 3nm. It wouldn't be optimal, but it would work."

Qian was looking at him, and he could see her running the calculation. The brake vs. the accelerator. Weihao was proposing they take both paths—the risky fast one and the safer slow one.

"Hedging," she said finally. "I can support that. If the 5nm tape-out succeeds, we get maximum performance. If it fails or gets sanctioned, we fall back to 7nm production at domestic fabs they can't easily restrict."

Vice Minister Chen considered this. "Cost?"

"Significant," Liu Wei admitted. "We'd be running parallel development streams. Double the engineering resources."

"But half the geopolitical risk," one of the advisors noted. "The Americans sanction our access to ASML's EUV lithography for 5nm production? We pivot to DUV at 7nm."

Chen looked at his tablet, then at Weihao's father in the back row. Some unspoken communication passed between them. Then Chen nodded.

"Approved. Dual-track development. But I want weekly updates, not monthly. And Dr. Qian—your oversight role just became more important. We cannot afford quality failures. Understood?"

"Understood," Qian said.

"Then proceed. And Mr. Li—be prepared. When the Americans realize what you're building, they will respond. Aggressively."

---

The train back to Xi'an was quiet. Weihao stared out the window at the darkening countryside, his mind churning through implications.

The Americans knew. Not everything, but enough to be concerned. Which meant countermeasures were coming. Sanctions, yes. But also...

"They'll try to sabotage it," he said quietly.

Qian looked up from her tablet. "What?"

"The Americans. If sanctions don't work, they'll try other methods. Cyberattacks against Xu-0. Supply chain interference. Maybe even human agents trying to steal or corrupt designs."

"You sound paranoid."

"I sound realistic." He turned to face her. "We're building something that threatens their technology dominance. They've toppled governments for less."

Qian set down her tablet. "So what do you want to do? Add security measures? They're already extensive."

"Not just security. Redundancy. Compartmentalization. We should spin up a second Xu cluster—Xu-1—at a separate location. Different facility, different staff, different network. If one gets compromised, the other continues."

"That's expensive. And it splits our focus."

"It's insurance." Weihao pulled out his kernel notebook and sketched quickly. "Xu-0 in Xi'an continues hardware development. Xu-1—maybe in Shenzhen—focuses on software and network protocols. They share validated results but can't directly compromise each other. If an attacker gains access to one, they don't get both."

Qian studied the sketch. "You're thinking like someone who expects to be attacked."

"Because we will be."

She was quiet for a long moment, touching her jade bracelet. "Alright. I'll propose it to the ministry. But you know what this means?"

"What?"

"We're not just building a technology platform anymore. We're building a strategic capability that people will fight to control or destroy. That's a very different kind of responsibility."

Weihao clicked his knee once. "I know."

Outside, the sun had set completely. The countryside was dark except for the occasional lights of a town rushing past. Weihao caught his reflection in the window—exhausted, driven, and now apparently running a technology project that foreign intelligence services were actively monitoring.

His father's warning from years ago surfaced in his memory: *"Be careful what you build, son. Once it's important enough, it stops belonging to you."*

He opened his kernel notebook to a fresh page and wrote:

*March 13, 2026 - Ministry briefing*  
*Americans are watching (signals intel, satellites, human assets)*  
*New sanctions incoming (6 months, maybe less)*  
*Dual-track strategy approved (5nm + 7nm backup)*  
*Question: At what point does this stop being my project and become a strategic asset I merely steward?*  
*Answer: Probably already past that point.*

He closed the notebook and leaned back, feeling the train's rhythm beneath him.

Somewhere in Xi'an, Xu-0 was still running, burning through its 89 megawatts, designing hardware that would either change everything or become the most expensive dead end in Chinese technology history.

Somewhere in America, intelligence analysts were probably staring at satellite photos of the same facility, trying to figure out why a research campus in a snowy valley needed enough power to run a small city.

And somewhere in the space between, a race was beginning. Not the kind announced with starting guns, but the kind where you only realized you were running after your opponents had already started chasing you.

Weihao clicked his knee twice and forced himself to stop.

The train rushed on through the darkness.

---

**Fort Meade, Maryland - NSA Headquarters**  
**March 14, 2026 (March 15, Beijing time)**

Sarah Chen stared at the power consumption graph on her screen. Three months of data from overhead satellites, cross-referenced with grid monitoring intercepts.

The Xi'an facility had been flagged by the algorithm six weeks ago. Initial assessment: probably a new supercomputer installation for weather modeling or physics simulation. Standard Chinese research activity.

Then the pattern changed. The power draw went from sporadic to sustained. 89 megawatts, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. That wasn't normal academic research. That was something running continuously, urgently, obsessively.

She pulled up the signals intelligence overlay. Heavy encrypted traffic between Xi'an and multiple sites across China. Network topology suggesting distributed computation—not one big cluster, but coordinated systems communicating constantly.

"What are you building, Li Weihao?" she muttered.

Her supervisor, James Morrison, appeared behind her. "That the Chinese AI thing?"

"Yeah. And it's bigger than we thought. They're not just doing research. They're preparing for production deployment."

"Evidence?"

Sarah pulled up another window. "Supply chain intercepts. They've been quietly stockpiling lithography equipment from ASML, specialty photonics components from German suppliers, and rare-earth materials from... everywhere. This isn't a research project. It's an industrial program."

Morrison leaned closer. "How far along?"

"Hard to say. But the power consumption pattern suggests they've got something operational. An AI cluster. A big one."

"Recommendations?"

Sarah thought for a moment. "We need to understand what they're building before we can counter it. I'm requesting taskforce authorization—full spectrum intelligence collection. Signals, human assets, academic monitoring, supply chain tracking. Everything."

"You think it's that important?"

"I think Li Weihao just spent eighteen months visiting developing countries getting blocked by our export controls, then came home and started a project that requires as much power as a small city. Yeah, I think it's important."

Morrison nodded slowly. "I'll brief the Director. Prepare your formal assessment."

After he left, Sarah stared at the satellite image of the snowy valley. The Xi'an facility looked peaceful from orbit. Just buildings and parking lots and solar panels. Nothing obviously threatening.

But power consumption didn't lie. Whatever was running in those buildings was working very, very hard at something.

She opened a new document and began typing:

> INITIAL ASSESSMENT: PRC AI Development Program (Xi'an Site)
> 
> SUMMARY: Target of interest Li Weihao has established major AI research facility with sustained power consumption equivalent to Tier-1 supercomputer. Timeline correlation with subject's travel to sanctions-affected regions suggests counter-US technology strategy development...

She paused, chose her words carefully, and continued:

> THREAT LEVEL: To be determined, but potentially significant. Recommend immediate escalation to NSC-level monitoring.

She hit send and watched the document route through the classification system.

Across the Pacific, in a facility she'd never seen, Li Weihao was probably asleep. Or more likely, given the power consumption patterns, he was still working.

Two people, seven thousand miles apart, both staring at screens late at night, both trying to build or understand something that might reshape how the world computed.

Neither of them knew the other existed yet.

That would change soon.
