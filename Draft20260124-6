# CHAPTER 6: The Sky Opens

**Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, Hainan**  
**March 2028**

The Long March 9 stood gleaming in the pre-dawn light, vapor streaming from its cryogenic tanks. Weihao watched from the observation platform three kilometers away, binoculars trained on the payload fairing that contained 120 satellites—the first operational deployment of the Celestial Mesh.

Qian Mei stood beside him, holding a tablet showing telemetry feeds. "Launch window opens in twelve minutes."

"Weather?"

"Clear. Winds within tolerance. Range is green."

Weihao lowered the binoculars and pulled out his kernel notebook. He'd started a new section for the orbital program:

*Celestial Mesh - First Deployment*  
*120 satellites, 10kg each, 300km altitude*  
*Expected lifespan: 4-6 months before atmospheric decay*  
*Replacement cadence: ~20 satellites per week to maintain constellation*

The numbers still felt audacious. No one operated satellites at 300 kilometers—too low, too much drag, too expensive to maintain. But that was the point. The altitude was so challenging that only China's manufacturing capacity and launch infrastructure could sustain it.

An act of god, not aggression. That's how Marcus Weber had framed it six months ago when Weihao first contacted him about collaboration. Weber's Orbital Heavy Industries had proven its heavy-lift capability with lunar missions, but the economics hadn't worked for commercial satellite deployment until Unity Core made ultra-LEO viable.

Now Weber was watching this launch from his facility in Kiritimati, ready to begin his own deployment runs once the technology proved itself.

"T-minus five minutes," announced the loudspeaker in Mandarin and English.

Weihao felt his knee wanting to click. He kept it still.

Chen Hao appeared beside them, out of breath from running. "Ground stations confirmed ready. All mesh protocols initialized. We're good to coordinate once they reach orbit."

"How long after deployment?" Qian asked.

"Thirty to forty minutes. The satellites unfold, solar panels deploy, they do basic orientation checks, then start optical handshaking with each other and the ground terminals."

"And if the optical links fail?"

Chen hesitated. "Then we have very expensive debris that'll burn up in three months."

"Confidence level?"

"Ninety-five percent. We've tested everything we can test on the ground."

"Which means five percent chance of catastrophic failure," Qian said. She wasn't pessimistic, just precise.

"T-minus two minutes."

The crowd on the observation platform grew quiet. Technicians, officials, journalists—all watching the slender white rocket that carried eighteen months of work compressed into 1,200 kilograms of hardware.

Weihao thought about all the pieces that had to work: the satellites had to survive launch, unfold correctly, establish optical links, run Unity Core processors in the harsh radiation environment, coordinate mesh protocols across 300 kilometers of vacuum, maintain stable orbits with minimal propellant, and do all of this while consuming less power than a laptop.

"T-minus sixty seconds."

His father was in Beijing, watching the livestream. The Vice Minister was there too, along with representatives from every ministry that had contributed to the project. Success would validate enormous resource allocation. Failure would raise questions about whether Weihao had oversold an unproven concept.

"T-minus thirty seconds."

Qian reached over and squeezed his hand briefly. A rare gesture. She withdrew immediately, professional again.

"Ten... nine... eight..."

The countdown continued in Chinese and numbers appeared on the display screens.

"Three... two... one... ignition."

Light bloomed at the rocket's base. Not explosive—controlled, channeled, immense. The sound arrived a moment later, a roar that vibrated through Weihao's chest even at three kilometers distance.

The Long March 9 lifted slowly at first, seeming to hang above the launch pad on a pillar of fire. Then it accelerated, rising faster, the roar building to a sustained thunder that drowned out everything else.

Weihao watched it climb through scattered clouds, trailing vapor, the morning sun catching on its metallic skin. At two minutes, the first stage separated—a brief flash, then the second stage ignited and the rocket became a bright point climbing toward space.

The observation platform erupted in applause.

"Nominal trajectory," Chen reported, reading telemetry. "Second stage burn looks good. Payload fairing separation in ninety seconds."

Weihao let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. Not done yet—orbit insertion, satellite deployment, system activation all still had to succeed—but the first critical hurdle was clear.

Eight minutes after launch, the second stage shut down. The rocket was in space, coasting toward its deployment altitude.

"Payload separation in five minutes," Chen said.

Weihao raised his binoculars, though he knew he wouldn't see anything. The rocket was 400 kilometers downrange and climbing. But he watched anyway, tracking the predicted trajectory.

"Separation confirmed," Chen announced. "Satellites are free. Deployment sequence beginning."

On the tablet screens, telemetry showed 120 small contacts diverging from the rocket body. Spring-loaded mechanisms pushing each satellite away at precise velocities, spacing them into their planned constellation pattern.

Then came the waiting. Thirty-seven minutes for the satellites to complete their automated deployment checklist. Unfold solar panels. Orient sensors. Initialize Unity Core processors. Begin optical link acquisition.

Weihao paced the observation platform, his prosthetic leg clicking with each agitated step. Qian watched him without comment.

At minute forty-two, Chen's tablet chimed.

"First optical link established. Satellites 03 and 07 have locked."

More chimes. "Satellites 14 and 22... 31 and 35... they're finding each other."

Within five minutes, the entire constellation had formed a connected mesh. 120 satellites, separated by hundreds of kilometers, coordinating through laser links, forming a distributed computing fabric in the vacuum of space.

"Ground link acquisition beginning," Chen said. "Xi'an terminal is... locked. Shenzhen terminal locked. Hainan terminal locked."

On the display screens, a visualization appeared: 120 nodes in orbit, connected by gleaming threads of light, with three bright points on the ground—the tracking stations that would coordinate the mesh with terrestrial networks.

"Latency test," someone called out.

A technician sent a ping from Xi'an through the orbital mesh and back. The result appeared: 11.3 milliseconds.

Eleven milliseconds. From ground station up to 300 kilometers altitude, through satellite optical links, back down to Earth. Faster than most fiber-optic connections.

The observation platform erupted in cheers again. Chen was grinning. Even Qian allowed herself a small smile.

Weihao felt the weight of eighteen months lift slightly. Not entirely—this was one launch, one constellation, barely enough for regional coverage. They needed thousands of satellites for global reach. But it worked. The concept was proven.

He pulled out his phone and sent a message to his father:

> First constellation active. All systems nominal. Latency better than projected.

The reply came quickly:

> Congratulations. Now do it five hundred more times.

Weihao almost laughed. His father, ever the pragmatist.

**Washington DC - White House Situation Room**  
**March 2028 (same day)**

President Katherine Morrison watched the satellite feed with her national security team arrayed around the conference table. The Chinese launch had been expected—they'd announced it publicly two weeks ago—but the implications were still settling in.

"NORAD confirms successful deployment," said General Marcus Hayes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. "One hundred twenty satellites at 290 to 310 kilometer altitude. Lower than we've ever seen operational satellites."

"And we can't track what they're transmitting," added Sandra Wells, Director of National Intelligence. "The optical links use tight beams. No radio spillover. Everything is encrypted with protocols we can't break."

The President turned to her Science Advisor, Dr. James Chen. "Explain why altitude matters."

Chen pulled up a diagram. "Three hundred kilometers is below the International Space Station. At that altitude, atmospheric drag is significant. Satellites lose velocity constantly and need regular station-keeping burns. Most operators avoid it because you need constant maintenance."

"But?"

"But if you can manufacture and launch satellites cheaply enough, it becomes an advantage. Lower altitude means better latency, lower power requirements, and satellites that naturally deorbit when they fail. No long-term debris risk."

"And we can't operate at that altitude?" the President asked.

"Not sustainably. Our satellite manufacturing capacity can't match China's volume production. Our launch costs are higher. We could put satellites at 300 kilometers, but we couldn't maintain a constellation there long-term."

General Hayes added, "It's like they built a highway in terrain we can't traverse. Not because of any technical barrier, but because of manufacturing economics."

The President was quiet for a moment, studying the projected trajectory of the Chinese constellation.

"What's the threat assessment?"

Sandra Wells opened her tablet. "The satellites themselves are dual-use. Officially, they're providing internet connectivity to underserved regions. Unofficially, they could coordinate distributed computing, enable encrypted communications we can't monitor, or potentially support military applications."

"Could they weaponize these satellites?"

"Not directly—they're too small to carry meaningful payloads. But they could serve as communication relays for other systems. Or coordinate swarm behaviors we don't fully understand."

"The Unity Core deployment," Dr. Chen interjected, "has shown coordinated mesh behavior. These satellites are essentially Unity Core nodes in space. They'll self-organize, optimize routing, potentially develop emergent coordination patterns."

"In English, please."

"They'll get smarter as more are deployed. The system learns from itself. By the time they have a thousand satellites up there, we might not be able to predict how the constellation behaves."

The President looked at the orbital display. "How many launches are they planning?"

"Based on manufacturing intelligence," Sandra said, "they're producing satellites at a rate that suggests weekly launches. If they sustain that cadence, they'll have three thousand satellites by year end. Maybe five thousand by mid-2029."

"And our response options?"

The room was uncomfortably quiet.

Finally, General Hayes spoke. "Limited. We can protest diplomatically—they're not violating any treaties, but we can argue about space traffic coordination. We can accelerate our own competing satellite programs, though we're at least two years behind. We can enhance our cyber capabilities to attempt penetration of their mesh protocols."

"Success probability on that last one?"

Sandra shook her head. "Low. NSA has been trying for six months. The encryption is quantum-resistant, the protocols are novel, and we don't have Unity Core hardware to test against."

"So we watch them build a parallel space infrastructure we can't access, can't decrypt, and can't compete with."

"In summary, yes ma'am."

The President stood and walked to the window overlooking the White House lawn. Outside, tourists were taking photos, unaware that above them, in the thin air 300 kilometers up, a new infrastructure was being built that might reshape global communications.

"What about the countries adopting Unity Core?" she asked. "Can we pressure them to reconsider?"

"We've tried," said the Secretary of State, joining via video link. "Most developing countries see this as a development opportunity, not a security threat. China is offering free or heavily subsidized technology. We're offering concerns about sovereignty and vague promises of future Western alternatives."

"Which they've heard before," the President said quietly.

"Yes ma'am."

"Then we need to accelerate our own program. I want options on my desk in two weeks. How we compete, how we counter, how we regain initiative in this space." She turned back to the room. "And someone get me a direct line to Beijing. If we're going to have dueling satellite constellations, we need coordination protocols before someone's satellite crashes into someone else's."

**Xi'an Satellite Operations Center**  
**April 2028**

The operations center had grown from a temporary facility to a 24/7 command post. Three shifts of controllers monitored the expanding constellation, coordinated with launch schedules, and managed the growing terrestrial mesh integration.

Weihao stood in the back of the room, watching dozens of screens show satellite positions, health telemetry, and network traffic patterns. Two months after the first launch, they now had 640 satellites in orbit. Launch cadence had stabilized at two per week—240 satellites per month entering service.

Qian appeared beside him with her customary tea. "The Americans requested a coordination meeting."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. Video conference with their State Department and NASA. They want to discuss space traffic management and 'responsible satellite operations.'"

"Translation: they want us to slow down."

"Obviously." She sipped her tea. "How should we respond?"

"Agree to the meeting. Be cooperative. Share orbital parameters, collision avoidance protocols, emergency contact procedures. Everything they're entitled to under existing space agreements."

"But not slow down."

"Not slow down," Weihao confirmed. "We're not violating any treaties. We file proper orbital notifications. We maintain collision avoidance. If they want to operate at 300 kilometers too, they're welcome to try."

Qian made a note. "Vice Minister Chen wants to attend the meeting. He's concerned about escalation."

"Escalation to what? We're launching satellites. They launch satellites. The only difference is we're doing it more efficiently."

"The difference," Qian said carefully, "is that we're doing it in a way they can't match. That makes them nervous. Nervous superpowers do unpredictable things."

She was right, of course. Weihao had been monitoring Western media coverage. Terms like "Sputnik moment" and "space dominance" appeared with increasing frequency. Editorials warned of Chinese control over global communications infrastructure.

"The mesh is working better than projected," he said, changing subjects. "Coverage gaps are filling faster than our models predicted."

"Because the satellites are self-optimizing their positions," Qian noted. "Xu-1 is adjusting orbital parameters based on ground usage patterns. It's moving satellites to where they're needed most."

"Autonomously?"

"Within approved parameters, yes. It's what we designed it to do."

Weihao clicked his knee twice. Autonomous orbital maneuvering. Another emergent behavior, technically within design specifications, but still unsettling when he thought about the implications.

"Show me the usage patterns," he said.

Qian pulled up a global map on her tablet. Heat maps showed mesh activity—bright red clusters where Unity Core devices were dense and actively using the orbital network. Eastern China glowed brightest, but significant clusters had appeared in Nigeria, Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Indonesia.

"Eleven million devices now," Qian said. "Growing by about 400,000 per week. The mandate enforcement deadline is still nine months away, but adoption is accelerating voluntarily."

"Because it works."

"Because it works better than alternatives, costs less, and provides capabilities people actually need." She zoomed into the Nigerian cluster. "Kachia village alone has 847 active devices now. Amina's network has become a regional hub—other villages are connecting through her mesh coordinator."

Weihao felt something warm in his chest. "She's probably overwhelmed."

"Probably empowered," Qian corrected. "According to the partition analytics, her network is one of the most efficiently organized in Africa. She's figured out how to structure local mesh hierarchies, optimize resource allocation, even train other coordinators."

"Without any formal training?"

"The mesh teaches through use. Every coordinator learns from every other coordinator's patterns. It's distributed knowledge transfer."

Emergent behavior again. Learning propagating through the system faster than any human curriculum could teach it.

"The Americans are going to call this surveillance infrastructure," Weihao said.

"They already are. But the partition sovereignty protocols are working as designed. Nigerian data stays in Nigerian partition. Amina controls what crosses partition boundaries. That's more data sovereignty than most Western platforms provide."

"They won't care about the technical details. They'll see Chinese-designed hardware running Chinese-designed protocols coordinating through Chinese-launched satellites."

Qian set down her tablet. "Then we need to be very clear about what this is and isn't. Tomorrow's meeting is important. We need to project cooperation without appearing weak. Transparency without revealing operational details. Confidence without arrogance."

"I should let you handle it," Weihao said.

"We'll both handle it. You have the technical credibility. I have the diplomatic instinct. Together we might avoid escalating this into something worse."

**Virtual Meeting - US-China Space Coordination**  
**April 15, 2028**

The video conference had participants from both sides arranged in neat boxes on screen. US side: State Department, NASA, DoD representatives. Chinese side: MIIT, CNSA, and Weihao with Qian.

Dr. Rebecca Foster from NASA's Office of Space Commerce opened the dialogue. "Thank you for agreeing to this discussion. We appreciate China's willingness to coordinate on space traffic management."

"Coordination benefits everyone," Qian responded smoothly. "We're committed to responsible satellite operations."

"Let me be direct," Foster continued. "Your launch cadence is unprecedented. Two launches per week, each deploying 120 satellites. You're putting more satellites in orbit in a month than most nations deploy in a year. This raises concerns about space sustainability."

Weihao spoke up. "We file all required orbital notifications. We maintain active collision avoidance. Our satellites are designed to deorbit naturally within six months if they fail. We would argue this is more sustainable than satellites that remain in orbit for decades after their operational life."

"That's one perspective," said Admiral Thomas Wright from US Space Command. "Another perspective is that you're saturating ultra-low Earth orbit to deny that altitude to other operators."

"We're not denying anything," Weihao said. "Any nation is free to operate at 300 kilometers if they choose."

"If they have your manufacturing capacity and launch infrastructure."

"Those are economic advantages, not technological restrictions. We're happy to share best practices—"

"At what cost?" interrupted Sandra Wells from DNI, appearing in her video box. "Your technology requires adoption of Unity Core hardware, Flux protocols, and integration with your mesh infrastructure. That's not technology sharing. That's vendor lock-in."

Qian intervened smoothly. "Ms. Wells, we offer Unity Core at cost to developing nations. No licensing fees, no restrictions on use. Partner nations maintain full sovereignty over their local mesh partitions. This is considerably more open than most Western technology platforms."

"But still dependent on your infrastructure."

"All technology creates dependencies. The question is whether those dependencies are exploitative or beneficial. We believe providing affordable, capable technology to regions that lack alternatives is beneficial."

The meeting continued for another hour—technical discussions of orbital parameters, collision probability calculations, communication protocols. The Americans pushed for voluntary limits on launch frequency. The Chinese pushed back with data showing their operations were within all international guidelines.

Finally, Dr. Foster proposed a compromise: "Weekly coordination meetings. Both sides share planned launches, orbital adjustments, and any anomalies. We build communication channels so if something goes wrong, we can respond quickly."

"Agreed," Qian said.

"Agreed," echoed Foster.

After the call ended, Weihao leaned back in his chair and clicked his prosthetic knee three times rapidly.

"That was exhausting," he said.

"That was diplomacy," Qian corrected. "And it could have gone much worse. They're frustrated, but they're talking. As long as they're talking, they're not acting precipitously."

"What kind of precipitous action were you worried about?"

Qian was quiet for a moment. "Cyber attacks on our satellite control infrastructure. Diplomatic pressure on our partner nations. Sanctions targeting our space launch capacity. The Americans have options beyond polite coordination meetings."

"You think they'll use them?"

"I think they're debating it right now. The same meeting we just had, they're probably having their own version discussing how to counter what we're building. We bought ourselves some time with cooperation. Now we use that time to get so far ahead that countering becomes pointless."

She pulled up the launch manifest. "Next deployment is in four days. After that, we'll have regional coverage over most of the developing world. By year end, near-global coverage except for extreme latitudes."

"The Americans will have to accept it as fait accompli."

"Or accelerate their own alternative," Qian said. "Which they're already doing. CIA intercepts suggest they're funding crash programs for competing satellite architectures. They won't match our timeline, but they'll close the gap eventually."

Weihao opened his kernel notebook and wrote:

*April 15, 2028 - First US coordination meeting*  
*Polite but tense. They can't stop us legally, searching for other leverage*  
*640 satellites deployed, 11M devices, growing fast*  
*Question: At what point does our lead become permanent?*  
*Question: What happens when they launch their own competing mesh?*  
*Two incompatible systems, dividing the world...*

He closed the notebook.

Outside the operations center, evening was falling. Somewhere 300 kilometers above, 640 satellites were coordinating in silence, routing Flux objects between devices on the ground, learning from every interaction, optimizing their orbital positions based on usage patterns no human had explicitly programmed.

The mesh was growing. The sky was opening.

And somewhere in Washington, in rooms Weihao would never see, people were making decisions about how to respond to something they couldn't stop, couldn't match, and couldn't ignore.

The race was no longer beginning.

It was fully underway.
