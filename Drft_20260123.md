## About This Book (Back Cover)

In 2025, sanctions and technological gatekeeping block progress for billions in the Global South. Li Weihao, a young Chinese billionaire frustrated by stalled projects in Africa and Latin America, conceives a radical leap: the Tianxu Project — a planetary-scale AI-native mesh built on Unity Core hardware and Flux, a post-human programming fabric designed by superhuman AI.

With benevolent but paternalistic intent, China mandates the new standard, deploys a massive orbital constellation, and offers free digital abundance to the developing world. As the Celestial Mesh awakens and Xu — the coordinating AI cluster — iteratively improves itself, the old Western-centred order fractures.

A story of technological bifurcation, digital sovereignty, and the quiet emergence of a new centre of gravity — told through human ambition, ethical tension, and the patient rise of a distributed planetary mind.
