PROLOGUE: Light in the Dark
Kachia village, Northern Nigeria
October 2025
The solar panels hummed. Amina Ibrahim could hear them from across the schoolyard—a soft, steady note that meant everything was working as it should. She'd installed the array herself six months ago, working through the wet season when everyone said she should wait for dry weather. But the children couldn't wait. The old diesel generator had finally given up, and classes were being held under trees because the concrete schoolhouse was an oven without fans.
Now the panels tracked the afternoon sun with quiet precision, and inside, thirty-two children sat in front of tablets.
Thirty-two tablets. All of them broken in exactly the same way.
Amina stood in the doorway, watching Teacher Halima tap uselessly at a screen frozen on a language lesson. The app needed an update. The update needed a server connection. The connection needed components that were, according to the terse message on Amina's phone, "currently unavailable for export to your region due to updated technology transfer restrictions."
She'd spent two hours on a satellite call with NovaTech's Lagos office that morning. The woman on the other end had been apologetic, professional, and completely helpless.
"I understand your frustration, Ms. Ibrahim. We're working on alternative solutions."
Alternative solutions. Amina had learned what that meant. It meant: wait longer, expect less, accept that some children get magic and yours get broken screens.
A boy—Yusuf, maybe eight years old—looked up from his dead tablet. "Miss Amina, when will it work again?"
She'd run out of creative answers. "Soon," she said, because what else could she say?
Outside, a black SUV pulled up, dust rising behind it. Unusual. Government vehicles rarely came this far north unless something was wrong. Amina walked out, shading her eyes against the sun.
A man stepped out of the passenger side. Chinese, young—maybe thirty—wearing khakis and a button-down shirt that somehow remained crisp despite the heat. His shoes were Italian leather, she noticed. Expensive. Dust already settling into the fine stitching.
Behind him, the NovaTech regional manager emerged from the driver's side, looking harried.
"Ms. Ibrahim," the manager said quickly, "this is Mr. Li Weihao. He's... he wanted to see the installation personally."
Li Weihao extended his hand. His grip was firm but not aggressive. "Please, just Weihao." His English carried a faint American accent—educated abroad, she guessed. "Your solar array is performing above projected efficiency. Congratulations."
Amina gestured toward the school. "The panels work perfectly. Everything that should sit on top of them doesn't."
His expression didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. "May I see?"
She led him inside. He moved carefully, economically, and she noticed he favored his left leg slightly. An old injury, compensated for so smoothly most people wouldn't catch it.
Weihao stopped in front of Yusuf, who was tapping the frozen tablet with patient hope. "May I?"
The boy handed it over. Weihao examined the screen, his face neutral. Then he pulled out his phone, scrolled through something, and set his jaw.
"The restricted component list was updated seventeen days ago," he said quietly, more to himself than to her. "Server-grade inference chips. Memory controllers. Even the mesh network adapters." He looked up. "Someone, somewhere, decided these parts could be dangerous."
"Dangerous to who?" Amina asked.
Weihao didn't answer. He crouched down to Yusuf's level. "Why is it slow, uncle?" the boy asked in Hausa.
Weihao smiled—a careful expression that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Because some very careful people far away think fast things can be dangerous."
Yusuf nodded solemnly, as if that made perfect sense.
Amina watched Weihao stand, watched him check his phone again, watched him look at the neat rows of children and broken tablets. Something was happening behind his eyes—a calculation, a decision taking shape.
"Thank you for showing me this," he said finally. "I needed to see it myself."
"Will it help?" she asked.
He met her gaze. "I don't know yet. But I promise you—something will change."
After he left, Amina stood on the ridge where the solar panels caught the last of the afternoon light. The SUV was already a dust trail in the distance.
She didn't believe him. She'd heard promises before.
But she remembered the way he'd looked at those children. Not pity. Not charity.
Rage, maybe. Controlled and cold, but rage nonetheless.
She'd take that over pity any day.

CHAPTER 1: The Frustration Threshold
Kachia village, Northern Nigeria
October 23, 2025
Li Weihao stood on the ridge above the village, watching the sun drop toward the horizon. Below him, the NovaTech solar array tracked the light with mechanical grace. Perfect performance. His augmented glasses confirmed it: 97.3% of projected output, well within tolerance, inverters running cool.
None of it mattered.
He removed the glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Three nights of poor sleep were catching up with him. The flight from Shanghai had been thirteen hours of turbulence and scattered attempts at rest. His body wanted to be somewhere else on the planet's rotation. His mind refused to slow down.
The diagnostic overlay had shown him exactly what he expected: the hardware worked flawlessly. The software waiting to run on it was frozen in bureaucratic amber.
Weihao shifted his weight, feeling the familiar asymmetry. His left leg—carbon fiber and titanium beneath the khaki fabric—clicked softly as he adjusted his stance. An unconscious habit when he was thinking. He caught himself and stopped.
"They keep asking when the new apps will work," Amina said beside him. Her arms were folded, her voice flat with the exhaustion of someone who'd run out of creative ways to deliver bad news. "I tell them the network is coming. They believe me less each time."
"I know," Weihao said. "It's not the panels failing. It's everything that should sit on top of them."
He'd spent the morning reviewing the latest sanctions notices. The language was always neutral. Professional. No malice, just administrative precision. Items added to control lists. Entities designated.Harmonized standards for responsible technology transfer.
The effect was a noose tightening by millimeters.
A ten-year-old boy approached, struggling with a tablet that buffered endlessly on a simple educational video. The loading circle spun. Stopped. Spun again.
"Why is it slow, uncle?" the boy asked in Hausa.
Weihao crouched down, balancing carefully. His prosthetic knee locked with a quiet click. "Because some very careful people far away think fast things can be dangerous."
The boy nodded seriously and went back to waiting for his video to load.
Weihao watched him go, then stood. The sun was bleeding red across the horizon now, and he needed to head back to the guest house before full dark. Kachia had electricity now, but the roads were still dirt and the driver didn't like navigating them at night.
"Walk with me a moment?" he asked Amina.
They descended the ridge in silence. Weihao's gait was smooth but deliberate—he'd long ago mapped out which stride patterns minimized the visible limp. Left foot, weight transfer, right foot, slight pause. Natural to him now, though he still caught people noticing. Amina didn't. She walked like someone used to rough terrain, and she matched his pace without comment.
"How long have you been here?" he asked.
"Two years. I trained in Lagos—electrical engineering, renewable systems specialization. They offered me Lagos or here. I chose here."
"Why?"
She glanced at him. "Because Lagos has fifty engineers. Kachia has me." She paused. "Had me. Now I spend most of my time explaining why things don't work."
Weihao pulled out his phone and showed her the sanctions list he'd been reviewing on the flight. "Seventeen days ago. They added server-grade inference chips, distributed mesh protocols, and advanced memory controllers."
"Those tablets need all of that?"
"No. But the systems those tablets talk to do. Cut the infrastructure, and the edge devices become very expensive paperweights."
Amina stopped walking. "This is deliberate."
"Of course it's deliberate. Whether it's justified..." He trailed off, looking back at the school. Through the windows, he could see children still tapping hopefully at frozen screens. "The people making these decisions genuinely believe they're protecting something important."
"Are they?"
"Probably." Weihao met her eyes. "The question is whether protection requires deprivation."
She studied him for a long moment. "You're going to do something about this."
It wasn't a question. Weihao felt something shift in his chest—the same feeling he got when disparate ideas suddenly connected in his kernel notebook. The click of recognition.
"Maybe," he said. "I don't know what yet."
They reached the guest house as the last light faded. The driver was waiting, engine running. Weihao thanked Amina and climbed into the back seat.
The guest house was a concrete box with a generator, a ceiling fan, and a narrow bed. Weihao poured himself a measure of whisky from the flask he carried for exactly these moments—Yamazaki, a small indulgence that reminded him success was real and not just numbers on screens. The burn helped blunt the edges.
He opened his laptop and scrolled through the latest reports. Cancelled irrigation controllers in Tamil Nadu. Frozen telemedicine servers in Ethiopia. Smart-grid components stuck in Brazilian customs for "additional review."
A message from Elena Ramirez in São Paulo appeared on his screen:

Another week, another list of things we can't ship. You holding up?

He typed back:

Barely. We're redesigning around older chips again. It feels like running up a down escalator.

Elena's reply came quickly:

At least you can afford the redesign. Most of my partners can't. They're just dead in the water.

Weihao leaned back, the cheap chair creaking under him. Elena had been his contact point in South America for three years now—sharp, pragmatic, and increasingly frustrated with the same walls he kept hitting. They'd met at a development conference in Singapore, bonded over shared exasperation with bureaucratic obstacles, and maintained a professional friendship built on mutual respect and dark humor.
Some of his colleagues thought they'd been involved romantically. They were wrong, though Weihao suspected Elena wouldn't have minded if they had been. He'd been too focused to notice the opening, and by the time he realized it existed, she'd moved on.
His last actual relationship had been with an American journalist based in Beijing. Brilliant woman, patient for eighteen months, until she finally told him he was "married to the mission." She wasn't wrong. He'd tried to argue that his work was important, that she understood that. She'd agreed completely. Then she'd left anyway.
He poured another small measure of whisky and stared at the sanctions notices.
Something Elena had said stuck with him: "They're just dead in the water."
Weihao opened his kernel notebook—a leather-bound journal he'd been keeping since his Stanford MBA days. Not a diary. A collection. Ideas that caught his attention, observations that didn't fit anywhere yet, fragments waiting for connection.
He flipped through recent entries:
—Termite mounds: decentralized ventilation systems, no central control, emergence from simple rules
—Mycelium networks: resource sharing across vast distances, resilient to local failure
—Meissner effect: superconductors don't block magnetic fields, they exclude them entirely (displacement as power)
—"Appropriate technology" debate: Is tech "appropriate" if it requires permission from distant gatekeepers?
He stared at that last entry for a long time.
Then he turned to a fresh page and drew quickly:
A triangle with three vertices labeled: CODE | DATA | NETWORK
He stared at it. Eighty years of computing architecture, right there. Von Neumann's ghost, still haunting every processor on the planet. Code lives here, data lives there, network protocols live somewhere else entirely. Constant translation, constant overhead, constant inefficiency.
What if it was wrong?
He drew a circle next to the triangle and labeled it: INTEGRATED OBJECT
Inside the circle, he wrote: code + data + intent as single probabilistic structure
Beneath both diagrams, he added: Human language = constraint. What if machines could speak their own language?
He clicked his prosthetic knee twice, unconsciously, already three steps ahead.
Below that, he wrote the directive he'd been refining for weeks:
Maximize accessible intelligence for the maximum number of humans, with minimal energy and minimal gatekeepers.
He read it back. The words felt solid. Not complete—never complete—but solid enough to build on.
Weihao clicked his prosthetic knee unconsciously, a habit that emerged when he was three steps ahead of himself, already gaming out implications.
If you couldn't use the existing stack because it was gatekept...
If performance gaps could be closed through efficiency rather than brute force...
If you built something so alien to the current paradigm that restrictions became irrelevant...
He grabbed his phone and started a new note, typing quickly:
Consolidate domestic AI development → unified direction
Custom substrate → optimize for directive, not general compute
Mandate adoption → scale advantage
Orbital backbone → bypass terrestrial gatekeeping
Priority partnerships → Global South first
He stopped, read it back, and felt his heart rate increase slightly. This wasn't just another workaround. This was a different game entirely.
His phone buzzed. A message from his father:

Landing Shanghai 23:00 tomorrow. Dinner at the house. Your mother insists.

Weihao smiled despite himself. His father's messages were always commands disguised as invitations, and his mother's insistence was always invoked whether or not she'd actually insisted. But he'd go. He always did.
He typed back:

I'll be there. Something I want to discuss with you.

The reply came instantly:

Good. I also have something to discuss with you. Related to your African projects.

Weihao stared at that message. His father was many things—brilliant engineer, ruthless businessman, demanding patriarch—but he was never vague. If he was being oblique, it meant something significant was in play.
Weihao closed the laptop and finished his whisky. Through the window, Kachia village was dark except for the steady glow from the solar battery system. Light in the dark. Power without permission.
He pulled out his kernel notebook again and added one more line:
The stack is the cage. Build a different stack.
He didn't send the notes anywhere. Not yet. But the thought no longer felt abstract.
It felt inevitable.
Outside, the generator coughed and settled into its nighttime rhythm. Weihao lay down without undressing, knowing sleep would be fragmentary at best. His mind was already three moves ahead, connecting dots, building scenarios.
Somewhere in Xi'an, there was a semiconductor research facility with excess capacity.
Somewhere in Beijing, there were AI researchers frustrated with fragmentation and bureaucratic friction.
Somewhere in orbit, there was a band of altitude no one had claimed because no one else could use it efficiently.
And somewhere in his father's house in Shanghai, there was a conversation waiting that would either open a door or close it.
Weihao clicked his prosthetic knee twice—left, right, left—and forced himself to stop.
Tomorrow, he'd start finding out which.

CHAPTER 2: The Proposal
Shanghai → Hangzhou
November 8, 2025
The high-speed train cut through the dawn fog at 350 kilometers per hour. Weihao watched the countryside blur past—rice paddies giving way to industrial parks, construction cranes everywhere, China building itself into the future one concrete pour at a time.
He'd opened the presentation four times since boarding. Read the executive summary. Closed it. Repeated.
The document was solid. He knew it was solid. Dr. Qian Mei was going to tear it apart anyway.
His phone buzzed—a message from his father:

The NCDD meeting is not a formality. Zhang Lin is listening, but others are skeptical. Qian Mei will challenge you specifically. She was my recommendation.

Weihao read it twice. His father rarely admitted to maneuvering behind the scenes, which meant this was important enough to acknowledge openly. The message continued:

You asked for this platform. Now prove you deserve it. I told them you would.

No pressure, then.
Weihao pocketed the phone and pulled out his kernel notebook instead. He'd made three new entries since returning from Nigeria:
—Information wants to be free (Stewart Brand). Does intelligence?
—"First, do no harm" applies to engineers too
—von Neumann architecture is 80 years old. What if the bottleneck IS the architecture?
He traced his finger over that last line, then flipped back several pages to a sketch he'd made on the flight from Lagos:
A triangle labeled "Traditional Computing":

Vertex 1: CODE (human-readable instructions)
Vertex 2: DATA (stored separately)
Vertex 3: NETWORK (protocol stack, overhead)

Below it, a single circle labeled "Integrated Object":

Code + Data + Network intent fused
Optimized for machine interpretation
Humans need translation layer to audit

He'd written beneath the circle: If AIs don't need to read human languages, why force them to speak in them?
The question had been haunting him. Every line of code was a compromise—written for humans to understand, executed by machines that didn't care about readability. The translation overhead was invisible but enormous.
What if you let the machines talk to each other in their own language?
The train began decelerating as West Lake appeared through the fog. Weihao closed the notebook and checked his reflection one more time. He'd dressed carefully: dark jeans, button-down shirt (no tie), his father's vintage Omega watch. The studied casual of someone who understood clothing as signal but refused to be defined by it.
His prosthetic leg was invisible beneath the fabric. Most people never noticed it. Those who did usually pretended they hadn't. He preferred that to the alternative—performative sympathy or worse, inspirational platitudes.
The National Committee for Coordinated Digital Development occupied a landscaped campus west of the city, modern low-rise buildings half-hidden by bamboo groves. Weihao had been here once before, for a standards harmonization meeting that accomplished nothing memorable. Today felt different.
Dr. Zhang Lin met him at the entrance—mid-fifties, wire-rimmed glasses, the patient demeanor of someone who'd spent a career translating between researchers and bureaucrats.
"Mr. Li." A brief handshake. "The panel is assembled. They're... attentive."
"That's diplomatic."
Zhang smiled faintly. "You'll see. This way."
The review room was larger than Weihao expected. Eleven people around an oval table. He recognized most of them: Dr. Liu Wei from Shanghai Microelectronics, several AI institute directors, urban development scholars, even someone from the Ministry of Ecology focusing on energy implications.
And at the center, Dr. Qian Mei.
She was smaller than Weihao had pictured—maybe 160 centimeters, petite build—but she commanded space in a way that had nothing to do with physical size. Impeccably dressed in dark gray with subtle jade jewelry, her hair cut short and sharp, silver streaks catching the light. She wore reading glasses on a chain and was currently using them to review a document, her expression giving away nothing.
She looked up as Weihao entered, and he felt the assessment behind her eyes. Quick. Thorough. Unimpressed.
"Mr. Li," she said. Not hostile, but not warm. "We've been reading your proposal. Please, sit."
Weihao took the indicated chair. His knee clicked softly as he sat—barely audible, but Qian's eyes flicked down and back up. She'd caught it. Noted it. Filed it away.
Zhang Lin made brief introductions. Weihao nodded to each panelist, making eye contact, reading body language. Most were neutral-curious. Liu Wei from semiconductor manufacturing looked skeptical. Qian Mei looked like she was waiting for him to say something wrong.
"Begin whenever you're ready," Zhang said.
Weihao opened his laptop but didn't look at it. He'd memorized this part.
"Over the past eighteen months, I've visited forty-seven sites across Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. Infrastructure projects where Chinese technology and financing were supposed to create opportunities." He pulled up the first slide: children in Kachia, frozen tablets in hand. "What I found instead were widening gaps. Physical infrastructure that works perfectly. Digital infrastructure that's increasingly blocked."
Liu Wei interrupted. "The restrictions are external. We can't control—"
"I'm not asking us to control them," Weihao said. "I'm asking us to make them irrelevant."
He clicked to the next slide: the sanctions list, color-coded by restriction date and impact severity.
"Seventeen separate component categories added in the last six months. Each one fragments our ecosystem further. We redesign around restrictions. They add new restrictions. We fall behind. The cycle continues."
A younger researcher from Shenzhen spoke up: "So we build domestic alternatives. We're already—"
"Playing catch-up," Weihao finished. "Yes. And we'll always be catching up if we're playing their game." He paused. "I'm proposing we play a different game."
Qian Mei set down her tea. "Explain."
Weihao clicked to his kernel notebook sketch, now rendered as a technical diagram.
"The bottleneck isn't the chips. It's the paradigm." He pointed to the triangle. "Every computation we perform today separates code from data from network protocol. This architecture is eighty years old, designed when computers filled rooms and humans punched cards by hand."
He let them absorb the diagram before continuing.
"What if we let AI systems design their own communication format? Not code humans can read—compact integrated objects that fuse intent, data, and network protocol into a single structure. Optimized for machine interpretation, not human readability."
The room went quiet. One of the AI researchers leaned forward. "You're describing post-linguistic programming."
"Exactly. If the goal is machine collaboration, why constrain them to human language?" Weihao clicked to the next slide: performance projections. "Preliminary estimates suggest 50-to-100-times compression ratio. A distributed inference task that currently requires megabytes could fit in kilobytes."
Liu Wei shook his head. "Even if theoretically possible, this would require completely new silicon architecture. We'd need—"
"Custom hardware, yes." Weihao clicked again. "Which is why I'm proposing we consolidate our frontier AI models into a single directed cluster and give it one job: design the substrate it needs to execute this new paradigm efficiently."
He pulled up the core proposal.
"Consolidate domestic AI development. Build a cluster optimized for one objective: maximizing accessible intelligence per watt, per yuan, per user, with minimal dependence on gatekept components. Let this cluster design both the communication format and the hardware to run it. Then mandate adoption domestically and offer it freely to partner nations in the Global South."
Qian Mei put on her reading glasses—a deliberate gesture. The room quieted slightly.
"Let me make sure I understand," she said. "You want to create an AI that writes in a language humans can't read, running on hardware that same AI designs, and you want to mandate this nationally before we know if it works."
"No," Weihao said calmly. "I want to create an AI that writes in a language optimized for AI collaboration, running on hardware optimized for that language, with mandatory human-readable translation layers for auditing and oversight."
"Translation layers that introduce overhead."
"Eighteen to twenty-five percent, based on initial modeling. Which still leaves us 40-to-60 times more efficient than current architectures."
One of the ministry representatives leaned forward. "You're asking for national resources to support what amounts to a bet on unproven technology. What if this AI cluster produces something we can't validate? Can't secure?"
Weihao had been expecting this. "The directive is narrowly framed: maximize access and efficiency under known material and energy constraints. Human review gates remain at each major milestone. No design advances without joint sign-off from technical and oversight committees."
"Joint sign-off from who?" Qian asked.
"Technical experts. Ministry representatives." He paused. "Someone independent who can ask the hard questions."
Qian's eyebrow lifted fractionally. "Someone who isn't emotionally invested in proving you right."
"Exactly."
Liu Wei shuffled papers. "Even if we approve this conceptually, you're talking about re-prioritizing entire fab lines. We have commercial commitments—"
"To markets that are restricting our access," Weihao interrupted. "How long before those commitments become liabilities?"
He pulled up fabrication projections. "We can start with existing 5-nanometer process nodes—SMIC has demonstrated capability. The AI cluster will optimize for what we have, not what we wish we had. And as it iterates, it can design for future nodes as they become available."
An AI researcher from Beijing spoke up: "This communication format you're describing—does it have a name?"
Weihao smiled slightly. "Not yet. But the working designation is Flux. Short for 'flux-state objects'—probabilistic structures that encode intent and data simultaneously."
"Flux," Qian repeated, making a note. "Poetic. Also vague."
"I have technical specs if you'd like details."
"I would. Later." She tapped her pen against her notepad. "Tell me about the orbital component. You mentioned mesh network deployment."
Weihao clicked to the satellite specifications.
"Ultra-low Earth orbit. 300 kilometers altitude."
The room reacted. Liu Wei's eyebrows went up. Zhang Lin looked surprised. Qian's expression didn't change, but her pen stopped moving.
"That's below ISS," someone said.
"Correct. Also below the altitude anyone else is seriously using because of atmospheric drag."
Liu Wei frowned. "Satellites at that altitude decay in months. You'd need constant replacement."
"Yes." Weihao pulled up a napkin-math slide he'd prepared for exactly this objection:
Ultra-LEO Economics (300km altitude)

Orbital period: ~90 minutes
Atmospheric drag: High (3-6 month lifespan)
Replacement rate: ~15-20% of constellation per month
Launch cadence required: 1 launch per week (120 satellites per launch)
Cost advantage: Lower altitude = smaller rockets, cheaper launches
Latency advantage: 300km vs 550km = 40% reduction in signal travel time

"No one else can sustain this cadence," Weihao said. "But we can. Our manufacturing capacity, our launch infrastructure, our supply chain efficiency—these are advantages we actually have right now, not aspirations."
Qian studied the math, then looked up. "You're describing a de facto seizure of an orbital band by making it economically inaccessible to competitors."
"I'm describing efficient use of a resource no one else has arrived at yet. They're welcome to join us if they can match the pace."
"They won't see it that way."
"Perhaps. But if we wait for international consensus, we'll wait forever. By the time they decide whether to join us, the altitude will be occupied by satellites providing free connectivity to three billion people who can't access it any other way."
An ecology ministry official spoke up: "What about debris risk? If satellites are decaying that fast—"
"They burn up completely on reentry," Weihao said. "At 300 kilometers, atmospheric drag is our ally. Failed satellites deorbit in weeks, not decades. The altitude is self-cleaning."
"And the satellites themselves?" Liu Wei asked. "How small can you make them?"
Weihao clicked to the engineering specs.
"Ten kilograms. Folded solar arrays, laser inter-satellite links, minimal propellant for station-keeping, and a custom chip at the heart—what we're calling Unity Core. The AI cluster will design it specifically for Flux execution."
Liu Wei stared at the numbers. "Ten kilograms including power, compute, and optical networking? That's impossible with current components."
"With current components, yes," Weihao agreed. "That's why we need the AI to redesign the components."
He let that sink in before continuing.
"The same efficiency gains that make Flux possible—integrated objects, minimal overhead—apply to hardware design. Unity Core won't be a general-purpose processor. It'll be a specialized accelerator for one task: executing and routing Flux objects as efficiently as physically possible."
Qian tapped her jade bracelet—Weihao noticed it was an unconscious gesture when she was thinking hard. "You're proposing a tight coupling between software paradigm and hardware architecture. If either fails—"
"Both fail," Weihao finished. "Yes. That's why the directive includes hardware and software co-design. They optimize together."
A younger researcher asked, "What about coverage gaps? 300 kilometers is very low orbit. You'd need more satellites to cover the same area."
"Correct. Which is why we'll supplement with atmospheric platforms during deployment." Weihao clicked to the next slide: high-altitude drones and stratospheric balloons. "While the orbital constellation builds out, we can fill coverage gaps with atmospheric mesh nodes. Drones at 20 kilometers, balloons at 30-35 kilometers. They provide interim connectivity and completely bypass space governance frameworks."
The room was silent for a moment. Then Qian spoke, her voice measured.
"You've thought about this quite a bit."
"I've had time on long flights."
She almost smiled. Almost. "Walk me through the timeline. From approval to first orbital deployment."
Weihao pulled up the schedule.
"Month 1-2: Consolidate AI models, establish Xu-0 cluster in Xi'an. Month 3-5: Flux specification development and validation. Month 6-8: Unity Core design iteration. Month 9-12: First silicon tape-out and testing. Month 13-15: Satellite production ramp-up. Month 16-18: First orbital deployment, 40-satellite test constellation."
Liu Wei whistled softly. "Eighteen months to orbit. That's aggressive."
"It's necessary," Weihao said. "Every quarter we delay, the gap widens. We're racing against time and policy, not just technology."
Qian set down her pen. "Let me be clear about my concerns. You're proposing we grant an AI cluster unprecedented autonomy to design languages we can't read natively and hardware we can't independently verify, then mandate national adoption and offer it freely to nations that may not understand the strategic implications."
"Yes."
"That's either brilliantly audacious or spectacularly reckless."
"It's both," Weihao said. "Which is why I need someone like you to make sure it's more of the former."
Qian studied him for a long moment. Then she looked at Zhang Lin. "I need to see the full technical specifications. And I want independent validation of these efficiency claims before we proceed."
"Of course," Zhang Lin said.
"And if this moves forward, I want quarterly reviews with full NCDD panel oversight. No black-box development."
"Agreed," Weihao said.
Qian turned back to him. "One more question. This Flux communication format—can it be copied? Once we deploy it, what stops Western competitors from reverse-engineering and implementing it themselves?"
Weihao had been waiting for this. "Nothing stops them from copying it eventually. But copying requires understanding, understanding requires the hardware to execute it efficiently, and designing that hardware requires the same AI-driven optimization we're doing. By the time they reverse-engineer Flux and build compatible silicon, we'll be two or three iterations ahead."
"You're building a moving target."
"I'm building a moat made of velocity."
Qian made a final note, then closed her notebook. "The panel needs time to discuss. Mr. Li, if you could wait outside?"
Weihao closed his laptop and stood. His knee clicked again as he rose. He was aware of Qian Mei watching him—not the leg, but his face. Reading for micro-expressions. Looking for tells.
He kept his expression neutral and walked out.

The courtyard outside was misty with November rain. Weihao walked slowly, letting the dampness settle into his jacket. He checked his phone—nothing urgent—and resisted the urge to review the presentation again.
His father's message sat in his inbox, unread but present:

I told them you would.

Pressure and confidence in equal measure. His father's usual approach.
Weihao pulled out his kernel notebook and added a new entry while the thoughts were fresh:
—Qian Mei: sees three moves ahead, asks the questions I need answering, doesn't trust optimism
—If she approves, she'll be the brake. Need brakes at this speed.
—Ultra-LEO is the right call. Seizure vs. efficiency = framing problem. She's right that distinction won't matter.
He was on his second loop around the courtyard when Zhang Lin emerged, expression carefully neutral.
"There is strong support," he said. "But also caution."
Weihao waited.
"The recommendation will go forward with modifications. You'll serve as civilian co-chair of the technical steering group. The cluster—designation Xu-0—will be established in Xi'an, leveraging the existing semiconductor research facility there."
Weihao felt something release in his chest. "Approved?"
"With conditions." Zhang paused. "Dr. Qian Mei will serve as oversight co-chair. All major design releases require joint sign-off from both of you. Milestones will be reviewed quarterly by the full NCDD panel."
Joint oversight with Qian Mei. That meant friction, deliberation, someone questioning every assumption. It also meant the project would proceed.
"I accept," Weihao said.
Zhang allowed a small smile. "We thought you might. Dr. Qian is waiting inside if you'd like to coordinate on next steps."
Weihao reentered the building. Qian Mei was still at the conference table, reviewing notes. She looked up as he approached.
"Congratulations," she said. No warmth, but no hostility either. "You got what you wanted."
"We both did," Weihao replied. "You get to make sure I don't drive this off a cliff."
"Oh, I intend to." She closed her notebook and stood—he had nearly fifteen centimeters on her in height, but somehow she still gave the impression of looking him in the eye. "Let's be clear about our dynamic. You're the accelerator. I'm the brake. We'll argue. Frequently. But when we sign off on something together, it means we both believe it's right."
"Agreed."
"Good." She picked up her bag. "The Xi'an facility will need significant retrofitting. I'll coordinate with the ministry on power allocation and cooling infrastructure. You'll handle the AI team assembly?"
"Already have a list."
"Of course you do." She paused at the door. "One more thing. Your father recommended me for this role. That doesn't mean I work for him. It means he knows I won't let you cut corners just because you're brilliant and impatient."
Weihao felt a smile tug at his mouth. "He said almost exactly that in his message to me this morning."
"Then we understand each other." She extended her hand. "I look forward to our arguments, Mr. Li."
He shook it. Her grip was firm, brief. "Weihao. And likewise, Dr. Qian."
"Mei. If we're going to fight, we might as well be informal about it."
She left without waiting for a response.
Weihao stood alone in the conference room, looking at the presentation still displayed on the screen. Maximum intelligence. Maximum people. Minimal gatekeepers.
He pulled out his phone and opened a secure interface. The Xi'an facility was already being provisioned—someone had started spinning up infrastructure before he'd even left the building. His father's hand, probably. Or Mei's. Maybe both.
He typed into the system initialization field:
Project designation: Xu-0
Primary objective: Design substrate optimized for directive constraints
Directive: Maximize accessible intelligence for maximum humans, minimal energy, minimal gatekeepers
He hesitated, finger over the submit key.
Then he pressed it.
The system acknowledged instantly:

Configuration accepted. Resource allocation beginning. Estimated integration time: 4-6 weeks.

Weihao closed the interface and headed for the train station. The maglev back to Shanghai would get him home in time for dinner with his parents.
He had a feeling his father was going to be pleased.
His mother would ask when he was getting married.
And somewhere in Xi'an, in a climate-controlled hall that used to manufacture test wafers, something new was beginning to wake up.
