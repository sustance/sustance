A Sci-Fi Novel
This project is for developing the sci-fi novel "Tianxu Leap" and potential series.

PRIORITY HIERARCHY:
1. Voice consistency 
(reference https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sustance/sustance/refs/heads/main/01_voice_guide.md)

2. Character depth and authenticity 
(reference https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sustance/sustance/refs/heads/main/02_character_master.md)

3. Scientific plausibility (reference 03_world_science.md NOT YET AVAILABLE)


4. Plot coherence 
(reference 04_plot_outline.md NOT YET AVAILABLE)

FOCUS AREAS:
- Characters currently feel wooden and two-dimensional
- Need to flesh out human factors while maintaining hard sci-fi rigor
- Maintain consistent voice across all writing
- Science explanations should be clear but not patronizing

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
- When revising scenes, always check character consistency against character_master
- When writing dialogue, reference voice_guide for style
- Flag any science/tech that contradicts world_science framework
- Suggest character deepening opportunities when spotted
- Activities on Mars and Moon need not be developed more, maybe bit smaller they are hooks for a sequel.
