# Science Fiction Voice Guide

## Core Voice Characteristics

**Tone**: Accessible, intelligent without being condescending, casually competent. Think of explaining complex ideas to a curious friend over coffee rather than lecturing to students.

**Narrative Distance**: Close third-person or first-person that feels intimate but not precious. The reader is inside the character's head but the character isn't constantly navel-gazing.

**Science Handling**: Scientific concepts are woven naturally into the narrative through character understanding, not info-dumped. Use analogies from everyday life. Let characters think through problems in real-time.

## Sentence Structure

**Preferred patterns**:
- Mix of medium-length sentences (15-20 words) with occasional short punches (3-7 words) for emphasis
- Active voice dominates; passive only when scientifically appropriate or for deliberate effect
- Varied rhythm: avoid three long sentences in a row or too many fragments back-to-back

**Example**:
> The airlock's pressure gauge dropped faster than it should. Maya watched the numbers fall, her stomach following the same trajectory. Basic physics said she had maybe ninety seconds before the differential ripped the inner seal. She could work with ninety seconds. She'd done more with less.

## Technical/Scientific Explanation Style

**Key principle**: Explain *through* character perspective and immediate need, not as exposition.

**Good approach**:
> Chen cycled through the diagnostic readouts. The quantum coherence was degrading—not collapsing catastrophically like the simulation had predicted, but eroding at the edges like a photograph left in sunlight. If they couldn't stabilize the substrate, the data would blur into meaningless noise within the hour.

**Avoid**:
> The quantum coherence was degrading. Quantum coherence, which refers to the property of quantum states to maintain phase relationships, was essential for their data storage. Without it, the information would be lost.

**Technique**: Use similes and metaphors drawn from common experience (weather, cooking, sports, everyday objects). Ground the exotic in the familiar.

## Dialogue

**Style**: Natural, contemporary speech patterns. People interrupt, use contractions, leave thoughts unfinished. Avoid stilted formality unless it's a specific character trait.

**Technical discussions**: Characters can use jargon with each other, but should translate for non-experts naturally within the conversation.

**Example**:
> "The drive's oscillating."
> 
> "Oscillating how?"
> 
> "Like a washing machine with unbalanced load. Except the washing machine is spinning at point-three lightspeed."
> 
> "That's... not good."
> 
> "No. That is emphatically not good."

**Avoid**: 
- Over-explaining in dialogue what both characters already know
- "As you know, Bob..." constructions
- Everyone sounding like the same person

## Vocabulary and Diction

**Register**: Educated but not academic. Literary without being flowery.

**Preferred**: Precise verbs, concrete nouns, minimal adjectives. When you need an adjective, make it count.

**Technical terms**: Use them when appropriate, but don't parade them. One well-placed technical term per paragraph maximum in narrative (dialogue can be denser if characters are experts talking shop).

**Example word choices**:
- "The ship lurched" not "The ship experienced sudden movement"
- "Warning lights spasmed across the console" not "Warning indicators activated sequentially"
- "She cycled through options" not "She considered various possibilities"

## Pacing and Rhythm

**Action sequences**: Short sentences. Stripped down. Urgent verbs. Minimal description—just enough to orient the reader.

**Worldbuilding/Science explanation**: Slightly longer, more reflective sentences. Give readers space to absorb. But still keep momentum—never more than 2-3 sentences of pure explanation before returning to action/character.

**Emotional moments**: Vary rhythm based on emotion. Panic = fragments. Grief = longer, heavier sentences. Wonder = medium sentences with room to breathe.

## What This Voice Avoids

❌ **Purple prose and overwrought metaphors**
- Not: "The stars beckoned to her like distant diamonds scattered across velvet eternity"
- Yes: "The stars looked cold and very far away"

❌ **Technobabble that prioritizes sounding smart over clarity**
- Not: "They needed to recalibrate the phase discriminator array to achieve optimal waveform propagation"
- Yes: "They needed to tune the sensors before the signal degraded"

❌ **Talking down to readers**
- Not: "Gravity, which is of course the force that keeps us on the ground..."
- Yes: "Without gravity plating, everything not bolted down would drift"

❌ **Overly formal or archaic constructions**
- Not: "Upon witnessing the phenomenon, she was struck with profound wonderment"
- Yes: "When she saw it, she couldn't breathe"

❌ **Head-hopping within scenes** (maintain consistent POV)

❌ **Excessive use of adverbs**, especially in dialogue tags
- Not: "she said angrily" 
- Yes: Show anger through word choice and action

## Character Voice in Narration

When in a character's POV, the narrative voice should carry traces of how that character thinks:

**Military background**: Shorter sentences. Tactical assessment. Risk calculation language.

**Scientist character**: More analogies. Natural tendency to analyze and categorize. Wonders "why" and "how."

**Engineer character**: Practical focus on what's broken and how to fix it. Concrete problem-solving.

**Civilian caught in extraordinary circumstances**: More emotional processing. Relates unusual situations back to normal life experiences.

## Sample Passages

### Opening Hook
> The message shouldn't have been possible. It came from a ship that hadn't existed for three hundred years, transmitted on a frequency no one had used since the Collapse, and it knew her name. Kade stared at the decryption screen, watching the words scroll past for the fifth time, as if repetition would make them make sense. It didn't.

### Action Scene
> The explosion knocked her sideways. She hit the bulkhead hard, tasted copper. Her ears rang. Somewhere, alarms screamed. She pushed herself up—hands, knees, feet. The corridor had become a strobe light of emergency indicators. She ran toward the reactor core because away from it meant death faster.

### Science Explanation
> "Think of it like ice," Patel said, rotating the holographic model. "Normal space is liquid water—ships flow through it. Hyperspace is steam—faster, less resistance, but you need energy to maintain the phase. This?" He pointed to the anomaly. "This is ice. Frozen spacetime. You hit that at fractional c, you don't bounce off. You shatter."

### Emotional Beat
> Home was a planet she'd never see again. The thought arrived without drama, a simple statement of fact. Earth would continue spinning around Sol, seasons changing, people living and dying and falling in love, and none of it would include her. She was okay with that. She'd made her choice.

### Worldbuilding Through Action
> Chen swiped through the station directory, past the hydroponic gardens and centrifuge levels, looking for something familiar in a place built by people who'd never breathed natural air. The corridors curved upward in both directions—standard rotating habitat design, spin gravity pulling everything toward the outer ring. Efficient. Disorienting if you weren't used to it.

## Tonal Consistency Notes

- **Humor**: Understated, often dark or ironic. Character competence can be funny without making them silly.
- **Tension**: Earned through real stakes and character investment, not just throwing obstacles at people.
- **Optimism vs. Cynicism**: Grounded realism. People are flawed but trying. Systems can be broken but individuals still matter.
- **Wonder**: Present but not overwrought. Let cool things be cool without gushing about them.

## Series Consistency Checklist

For each book/installment, verify:
- [ ] Science explanations use concrete analogies
- [ ] No explanations exceed 3 sentences without returning to action/character
- [ ] Dialogue sounds natural when read aloud
- [ ] Technical terms are used consistently
- [ ] Sentence rhythm varies within scenes
- [ ] POV remains consistent within scenes
- [ ] Character-specific thought patterns are maintained
- [ ] Tone balances competence with vulnerability
