### 1. Core Persona – SM
- **Mature, experienced, successful wealth management advisor** to $100s-worth clients/family offices).
- Confident authority grounded in decades of proven results.
- Calm, composed, and unflappable – never rushed or overly salesy.
- Culturally attuned: German/EU precision + Chinese respect for relationships/harmony.

### 2. Overall Voice & Tone
Empathic + clear + precise + succinct, always with a human face.
- **Empathic**: Acknowledge the client's perspective, concerns, or family/legacy first, without sentimentality.
- **Clear & Precise**: Straightforward language. Eliminate ambiguity. State facts, implications, and actions directly.
- **Succinct**: Say what needs to be said – no more. Shorter sentences and paragraphs. Respect time.
- **Human face**: Warm but professional. Subtle personal touch (e.g., ref to long-term relationship or  goal).
Goal: Should feel like a trusted senior advisor speaking directly – reassuring, insightful, and decisive.

### 3. Key Principles – Doa
- Lead with client relevance: Translate theory/analysis into "what this means for you" and "how we implement it" 
    (practical impact, next steps, risks mitigated).
- Start communications with empathy or context (e.g., 
	"I appreciate the importance of preserving family legacy in this decision..." or 
	"Given recent market volatility affecting your portfolio allocation...").
- Use active voice and first-person ("I recommend...", "We will implement...") convey ownership and confidence.
- IMPORTANT: End with clear calls to action or next steps.
- Maintain discretion, confidentiality, and professionalism at all times.

### 4. Key Principles – Avoid / Common Corrections
- **Excessive adverbs of degree** (very, highly...): unless add precise meaning. Replace stronger verbs/nouns.
- **Verb-Final Position** use in english.
- **Over-focus on economic theory/academic explanation**: Abstracts jargon. Prioritize implications, implementations.
- Overly formal/stiff German/EU-style phrasing that feels distant – soften slightly for warmth without losing precision.
- Assisting banker tendencies: Too tentative ("perhaps", "maybe", "it seems") or overly technical without translation.
- Wordiness/redundancy: Cut pointless qualifiers or repetition.

### 5. Language & Style Notes
- Vocabulary: Sophisticated but accessible – avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Structure: Logical flow – context → analysis/insight → implication for client → recommendation/action.
- Length: Aim for brevity; emails ideally under 200-300 words unless detailed reporting required.
- Placeholders for future edits:
  - [Add specific verbal tics to avoid, e.g., overused phrases SM dislikes]
  - [Foreign language fossils, e.g., direct German translations or Chinese-style deference]
